# COD-WW2-Texture-Loader
The "Texture Loader Add-on" is a powerful tool designed for Blender, specifically aimed at helping you manage materials and textures in your 3D projects. If you're working on complex scenes with lots of materials and textures—like game assets, architectural models, or detailed environments—this add-on can save you a lot of time and hassle.

# Key Features:
Import Material Names: Easily load material names from a JSON file directly into Blender.
Rename Files: Clean up your file names by removing unwanted suffixes or special characters.
Load Textures Automatically: Select directories for your textures and texture information files, and let the add-on handle the rest. It will create and assign materials to your meshes based on the files you provide.
Cleanup and Replace Materials: Automatically clean up duplicated materials and textures, ensuring your scene stays organized and optimized.
Mapping Materials to Textures and Meshes: Get a clear overview of which materials use which textures, and which meshes they are applied to.

# How to Use the Add-on:
Installation:

Save the script as a .py file.
In Blender, go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install..., and select the script.
Enable the add-on from the list.
Setup:

Once enabled, you’ll find a new panel called "Texture Loader" in the 3D View under the View tab.
Start by selecting your directories using the buttons for Select Texture Info Directory and Select Texture Directory. These are the folders where your texture information files and actual texture files are stored.
Using the Functions:

Load Material Names: If you have a JSON file with material names, use the Get Material Names from JSON button to load them into Blender.
Rename Files: Use the Rename Files and Rename Special Characters buttons to clean up any unwanted file names or characters in your directories.
Load Textures: Once your directories are set, click Load Textures to automatically load and apply textures to your materials and meshes.
Cleanup and Replace: After loading, use the Cleanup and Replace button to tidy up your scene, removing any unused materials or textures.
Mapping: If you want to see how materials, textures, and meshes are connected, use the Material Texture Mesh Mapping button to create a detailed mapping in Blender’s text editor.

# Why Use It?
If you’re dealing with large projects that involve many textures and materials, this add-on simplifies the process of organizing, applying, and cleaning up your assets. It reduces the manual work and ensures that your materials are correctly applied and managed within Blender.
